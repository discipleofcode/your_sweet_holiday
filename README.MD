#Your Sweet Holiday

It's just a simple project I made for Responsive Applications Desing classes.
There is a lot things to improve ( like colors or ie support ) but I've got
a passing grade ( quite good actually but my lecturer told me not to tell anyone
what I've got :P ).

I wanna make this into full-fledged RoR project helping me in managing my own
sweet holidays :)
